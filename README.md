# Dotfiles

This repository consists of all of my custom dotfiles.

$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./install.sh
```

I'm currently making use of [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/releases). While I love [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for everything else, I find [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/releases) to be easier on the eyes while in a terminal.

### Disclaimer

While the included `install.sh` script will backup your existing dotfiles before creating the symlink to use mine, I am not responsible for the loss of any data nor configurations and I highly suggest reading all shell scripts before blindly executing them.

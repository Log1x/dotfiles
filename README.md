# Dotfiles

This repository consists of all of my custom dotfiles for WSL.

I highly recommend [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) for maintaining your dotfiles.

## Installation

```sh
$ sudo apt install zsh zsh-antigen
$ gem install homesick
$ homesick clone log1x/dotfiles
$ homesick link dotfiles
```

## Font

I'm currently making use of [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/releases). While I love [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for everything else, I find [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/releases) to be easier on the eyes while in a terminal.
